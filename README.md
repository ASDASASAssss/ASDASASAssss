## About Me
Hi! I'm $HIFU ($$$)

I'm a passionate **self-taught programmer** who started learning programming in 10th grade. Currently, I'm diving deep into Python and C#, building fun projects that challenge me to think creatively and solve problems in innovative ways.

### My Coding Journey So Far:
- **Learn Linux**
- **First Python Project**: A cube-rolling game using `random` and colorful feedback using `colorama`. ðŸŽ²
- **Next Steps**: Building interactive scripts that take user input and experiment with cool libraries like `tkinter` for GUI fun. ðŸŽ¨
- Always eager to learn and level up my coding skills, one project at a time. ðŸ’»

### Languages & Tools:
- **Python**: Exploring its versatility through game simulations and user input challenges.
- **C#**: A language that Iâ€™m also practicing and growing with.
- **Modules I Love**: `random`, `tkinter.ttk`, `colorama`, `time`

I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, and new ideas! ðŸš€
